## Goals and Audience

The goal of this repository is to help the Replicated Solution Engineering team
pprogressively demonstrate the evolution of an application as a team adopts
additional features of the Reoplicated Platform. When you first clone the
repository, `HEAD` represents the final state of the application. The tags in
the repository represent different steps in the process of implementing
Replicated.

## Demonstating with this Repostitory

The best way to use this repository is to start with the complete version and
show various Replicated capabilities in the context of what the customer and
vendor each experience. This helps optimize the time you spend during your
demonstration by showing the value of the platform first, then digging into how
that value was derived later. It also lets you focus in on the areas that are
most interesting to your audience. You can use the tags in the repository to
explain different steps in the implementation in isolation from one another.
